Hereâ€™s a dedicated `README.md` for the **server** component of your **Decentraland Trust** project:

---

# Decentraland Trust Server

The **Decentraland Trust Server** provides the backend logic for the Decentraland Trust system. It manages reputation points, user interactions, and governance tools through APIs, and works either independently or alongside the UI. The server supports deployment using Docker for efficient production setups.

---

## Features

- **API-Driven Backend**: Provides endpoints for managing reputation, users, and governance operations.
- **Standalone Operation**: Can run independently or with the UI.
- **Docker Support**: Easily deploy the server using `docker-compose`.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (for containerized deployment)  

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metaverseunknower/dcl-trust.git
cd dcl-trust/server
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

In the `server` directory, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Development Setup

### Run the Server Locally

To start the server in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:34567` (or another port if configured).

---

## Docker Setup

You can run the server in a Docker container for easier deployment.

### 1. Build and Run the Server Container

From the `server` directory, use:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Access the Server

The server will be available at:

- **Server**: [http://localhost:34567](http://localhost:34567)

### 3. Stop the Server Container

To stop the container, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---
